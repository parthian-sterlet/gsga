# GSGA
GSGA is is abbreviated as Genetic Sensor generation by Genetic Algorithm. GSGA is the software package for the design of a synthetic oligonucleotide as a tandem array of separate transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs or cis-regulatory elements) from DNA sequences 

# Common description
The GSGA program complex (PC) is designed to select synthetic polymers (tandem arrays) of DNA sequence monomer units. These units are separate TFBSs of lengths from 7-8 to 20-30 base pairs (bp). They are also called cis-regulatory elements or individual binding sites (BS) of the target transcription factor (TF). Target TF implies the TF for which specific DNA binding is expected in the experiment. PC requires a library of DNA motifs ([D'haeseleer, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt0406-423)) representing BS models of different TFs from public databases of TFBS motifs. Currently PC is adopted for motifs of *A. thaliana* TFs from [Plant Cistrome](http://neomorph.salk.edu/dap_web/pages/index.php) database, it represents motifs derived by the *in vitro* DAP-seq technology ([Oâ€™Malley et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.063)). PC can be easily adopted for TFs from other taxa, e.g. mammals (human/mouse) and insects (drosophila), e.g. from [Hocomoco](https://hocomoco13.autosome.org/) ([Vorontsov et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1077)) or [JASPAR](https://jaspar.elixir.no/) ([Rauluseviciute et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1059)). PC applies the stannard motif model of Position Weight Matrix (PWM) [(Wasserman & Sandelin, 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg1315). PC searches for polymers in which the BS quality scores of the target TF are maximized and the BS scores of all non-target TFs are minimized. Default polymer contains TOut = 10 monomer units, each of them has length about 20-25 bp, so that central 5-12 bp in each unit are essential for TF binding (core) and its 5'/3' flanking 7-10 bp allow more variability (non-cores). PC can be used to design the structure of a polymer as an oligonucleotide of length about 200-250 bp.

PC implements the genetic algorithm approach to generate and select polymers. PC applies three consecutive steps, they solve the following issues:
* GA1, the first step creates a polymer, i.e. it selects participating monomers and defines their exact order;
* GA2, the second step improves a polymer by introducing certain single-nucleotide substitutions (SNSs) within non-core regions;
* GA3, the third step destroys a polymer given as a result of the first or second step by introducing certain SNSs within the core regions.

Generally GAs were developed according to the principles published earlier ([Levitsky et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-481); [Tsukanov et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545)). To start each step, each GA generates a population of randomly chosen solutions and gradually improves them to obtain the final set of solutions. For the first and second/third steps the solutions are a set of polymers and a set of SNS patterns for the certain input polymer, correpondingly. PC evaluates the solutions using a rank-based weighting scheme for motifs of potential TFBSs, and applies GAs to optimize the population of individuals, i.e. distinct polymers. The PC result, an oligonucleotide is called genetic sensor or biosensor. Subsequent incorporation of this biosensor into a transgene promoter for specific expression under the action of a target TF can be used as a marker of its presence. 

# Requirements
The source code is written in C++ language. To compile exetubables from the source code it is required:

* In Linux system, C++ compiler, e.g. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler 
* In Windows system any VC++ package, e.g. [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

# Repository structure
Folder [**src**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/src) contains two major C++ source code files, and two supplementary C++ source code files are provided in [MCOT repository](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/mcot-kernel).  

Folder [**run**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/run) contains the script [script](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/run/build.sh) for source code compliation, and three scripts implementing three command line examples, corresponding three steps.

Folder [**examples**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/examples) contains input files as examples of the three main steps.

Folder [**library**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/library) represents the library of PWMs, it contains two types of files: 
* files of PWMs as matrices of position-specific log-odds weights computed as desribed previously ([Levitsky et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-481); [Levitsky et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800)), and
* files of lists of recognition thresholds computed with the whole-genome set of promoters of protein coding genes, see Levitsky et al. ([2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800)) and Tsukanov et al. ([2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545)).

To make the recognition for all DNA motifs uniform, each threshold respects the expected recognition rate (ERR) value, this value means the probability of site recognition per one tested bp position in all promoters ([Levitsky et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.18699/vjgb-24-90)); hence, each file of the list contains two columns: (a) recognition threshold and (b) ERR value as Log<sub>10</sub>(probability), where the probability is ratio of the positions with recognized BSs (in either DNA strand) to the total number of tested positions in promoters.

# Pipeline description

# Common input data for all steps
* a set of weight matrices for non-target TFs;
* a set of preliminarily computed lists of thresholds and respective ERRs for each weight matrix ([Tsukanov et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545); [Levitsky et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800); [Levitsky et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.18699/vjgb-24-90)).

## First step, GA1
To generate a new polymer, the default number of TOut = 10 monomers are required in a polymer. The total number of distinct input monomer units TIn should be higher, TOut >= TIn = 10, to support the polymer specificity. These TIn monomers are presumed to be the native DNA sequences supported by ChIP-seq/RNA-seq etc. experimental edidence of specific binding of the target TF. The task of the first step is dual: 
1. to select exact output TOut monomers among the total TIn provided in input data; 
2. to denote the exact order of these TOut selected monomers.

For example, if we have 20 input monomers {T1, T2, ... T20}, then the example version of the ouput order of the selected top-scored ten monomers is {T17, T2, T5, T13, T4, T1, T18, T9, T15, T11}. To find an optimal combination, GA of the first step (GA1) selects the multiple versions of polymers with the least susceptibility to the non-target TFs binding. As input data, GA1 requires:
* a set of TIn monomer units containing individual binding sites of the target TF; 
* the number of TOut monomer units of a polymer; 
* a matrix for the target TF, and a list of its recognition thresholds and respective ERRs for this matrix.

## Second step, GA2
The second step (GA2) selects appropriate SNS outside the essential positions the target TF binding in each monomer. Hence, GA2 requires: 
* a polymer assembled from the units comprising the target TF binding site (the essential core) flanked by several nucleotides on 5' and 3' sides (less essential flanks, non-cores); 
* a matrix for the target TF, and a list of its recognition thresholds and respective ERRs for this matrix; 
* a list of positions in the polymer (the assembled sequence from the first step) designating spacers between the essential cores and non-core elements, and flanking regions before/after the first/last monomer units of the polymer; 
* the probability P of nucleotide substitutions (SNS) within non-core elements. 

## Third step, GA3
The third step (GA3) is another application of approach developped for the preceeding second step (GA2). Here the same source code is applied to destroy any DNA binding motif, hence it is not important here BSs of which TF to exclude. Hence, BSs of neither target nor non-target TFs are now undesirable. Hence, GA3 requires:
* a polymer assembled from the units comprising the target TF binding site (the essential cores) flanked by several nucleotides on 5' and 3' sides (less essential flanks, non-cores), this polymer may be the result of either the first or second step;
* a list of positions in the polymer designating the essential cores between the non-core regions and flanking regions before/after the first/last essential cores of the polymer;
* the probability P of nucleotide substitutions (SNS) within core elements.

* Second step: SNSs are allowed only in the non-core regions of a polymer thereby improving the binding of the target TF and restricting the binding of non-target TFs, or

## Supplementary programs
These programs are described in [MCOT repository](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/mcot-kernel/tree/master#generation-of-partner-library)
* Convertion from DNA motif as Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) to Position Weight Matrix (PWM), [pfm_to_pwm_mat.cpp](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/mcot-kernel/blob/master/src/pfm_to_pwm/pfm_to_pwm_mat.cpp). This program computes the weight matrix for given DNA motif, see  [example DNA motif](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/examples/order/dapseq0.motif) and [example weight matrix](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/examples/order/dapseq0.pwm)

This program computes the recognition thresholds as the list of pairs of values {Threshold, -Log<sub>10</sub>(ERR)} (see [example distribution](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/examples/improve/dapseq0.dist)) for a given weight matrix, see [example weight matrix](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/examples/order/dapseq0.pwm)

# Selction of weight matrices of the target and non-target TFs
The presence among motives of non-target factors of motives very similar to the selected motive of the target factor very negatively affects the quality of results of programs of all three steps. The examples provided in this repository show the G-rich non-canonical motif of the EIN3 TF as the motif of the target TFs (see file [dapseq0.motif](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/examples/order/dapseq0.motif) respecting to the PWM of the example target TF [dapseq0.pwm](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/examples/order/dapseq0.pwm). This motif does not show the high similrity to any motif from the DAP-seq library of motifs accepted here in analysis. To perform the correct selection of any arbitrary target TF and the provided here list of non-target TFs from DAP-seq user should test the similarity of tested motif of the target TF. The significane of similarity of the motif of the target TF should be estimated by the  stadard motif comparison tool [TomTom](https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/tomtom) (the option Select a motif database or provide motifs to compare with = 'ARABIDOPSIS (Arabidopsis thaliana) DNA. DAP motifs (O'Malley2016)'). If user found highly simialar DAP motifs, the list of motifs of presumed non-target TFs should be corrected. [XLSX file](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/matrices/DAP-seq_Plant_Cistrome_528_motifs_for_GSGA.xlsx) shows the list of all motifs used in both c++ files, [Order](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/src/genosensor_seq_order_ga.cpp) and [Improve and Destroy](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/master/src/genosensor_seq_ga.cpp). In any of these c++ file sees the piece just after the declaration of the main function

``` int main(int argc, char *argv[]) ``` 

Next, after parsing the command line arguments there is a line to select ignored motifs of non-target TFs, this line starts with 

```int m_ignore[] = ```

but not 

``` // int m_ignore[] = ```

since the first symbols in a line '//' mark a [comment in c++ language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/comments-cpp?view=msvc-170).

The default content of this line in both files [Order](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/src/genosensor_seq_order_ga.cpp) and [Improve and Destroy](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/master/src/genosensor_seq_ga.cpp) is 

```int m_ignore[] = { 2, 102, 183, 184, 186, 207, 212, 213, 217, 227, 286, 299, 300, 303, 439, -1 };// no anchor 2024 ```

Such line respects the default option in ignoring motifs, the program ignores only too short and degenerate DAP motifs, this is explained in the MCOT paper ([Levitsky et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800)). The numbers notation of all motifs showing the high sinilarity to the tested motif of the target TF should be added to the list of this line. Note that the standard statistical criterion p-value < 0.05 is too mild, the Bonferroni correction is p-adjusted < 0.05 / 528 < 0.0001, at least this threshold may be applied to find the significantly similar motifs. 

# Examples command lines:

These example command lines implement various steps for Linux OS:

2. [Improve](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/master/src/imrove) - Second step improves a polymer of native units to a polymer of synthetic units by SNSs within the non-core regions
3. [Destroy](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/master/src/destroy) - Third step destroys a polymer of native or synthetic units by SNSs withiin the core regions
