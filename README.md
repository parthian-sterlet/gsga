# GSGA
Genetic Sensor generation by Genetic Algorithm
GSGA is is abbreviated as Genetic Sensor generation by Genetic Algorithm. GSGA is the software package for the design of a synthetic oligonucleotide as a tandem array of separate transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs or cis-regulatory elements) from DNA sequences 
# Common description
The GSGA program complex (PC) is designed to select synthetic polymers (tandem arrays) of DNA sequence monomer units. These units are separate TFBSs of lengths from 7-8 to 20-30 base pairs (bp). They are also called cis-regulatory elements or individual binding sites (BS) of the target transcription factor (TF). Target TF implies the TF for which specific DNA binding is expected in the experiment. PC requires a library of DNA motifs ([D'haeseleer, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt0406-423)) representing BS models of different TFs from public databases of TFBS motifs. Currently PC is adopted for motifs of *A.thaliana* TFs from [Plant Cistrome](http://neomorph.salk.edu/dap_web/pages/index.php) database, it represents motifs derived by the *in vitro* DAP-seq technology ([Oâ€™Malley et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.063)). PC can be easily adopted for TFs from other taxa, e.g. mammals (human/mouse) and insects (drosophila), e.g. from [Hocomoco](https://hocomoco13.autosome.org/) ([Vorontsov et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1077)) or [JASPAR](https://jaspar.elixir.no/) ([Rauluseviciute et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1059)). PC applies the stannard motif model of Position Weight Matrix [(Wasserman & Sandelin, 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg1315). PC searches for polymers in which the BS quality scores of the target TF are maximized and the BS scores of all non-target TFs are minimized. Default polymer contains TOut =10 monomer units, each of them has length about 20-25 bp, so that central 5-12 bp in each unit are essential for TF binding (core) and its 5'/3' flanking 7-10 bp allow more variability (non-cores). PC implements the genetic algorithm approach to generate and select polymers. PC applies three consecutive steps, they solve the following issues:
* first step creates a polymer, i.e. it selects participating monomers and defines their exact order;
* second step improves a polymer by introducing certain single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) within non-core regions;
* third step destroys a polymer given as a result of the first or second step by introducing certain SNS within the core regions.

PC generates a population of solutions defined for each step. For the first/second steps these are a set of polymers and a set of SNS patterns, correpondingly. PC evaluates the solutions using a rank-based weighting scheme for motifs of potential TFBSs, and applies GAs to optimize the population of individuals, i.e. distinct polymers. PC can be used to design the structure of a polymer as an oligonucleotide of length about 200-250 bp. This oligonucleotide is called genetic sensor or biosensor. Subsequent incorporation of this biosensor into a transgene promoter for specific expression under the action of a target TF can be used as a marker of its presence. 

# Requirements
The source code is written in C++ language. To compile exetubables from the source code you need:

* In Linux system, C++ compiler, e.g. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler 
* In Windows system any VC++ package, e.g. [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

# Repository structure
Folder [**src**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/src) contains two major C++ source code files and two supplementary C++ source code files.  

Folder [**run**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/run) contains the main [script](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/blob/main/run/build.sh) for source code compliation, the three main scripts and the corresponding three command line examples, implementing different steps of the polymer search.

Folder [**examples**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/examples) contains the functional examples of the three main steps of the polymer search.

Folder [**library**](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/gsga/tree/main/library) represents the library of DNA motifs, it contains two types of files: (1) files of PWM motifs as matrices of log-odds weights computed as desribed previously ([Levitsky et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-481); [Levitsky et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800)) and (2) files of lists of recognition thresholds computed with the whole-genome set of promoters of protein coding genes, see Levitsky et al. ([2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800)) and Tsukanov et al. ([2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545)); to make the recognition for all DNA motifs uniform, each threshold respects the expected recognition rate (ERR) value, it means the probability recognition per one bp position in the promoters ([Levitsky et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.18699/vjgb-24-90)); hence, each file of the list contains two columns: (a) recognition threshold and (b) ERR value as Log10(probability), where the probability is ratio of the positions with recognized BSs (in either DNA strand) to the total number of tested positions in promoters.

# Pipeline description

# Common input data for all steps
* a set of weight matrices for non-target TFs;
* a set of preliminarily computed lists of thresholds and respective ERRs for each weight matrix ([Tsukanov et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545); [Levitsky et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800); [Levitsky et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.18699/vjgb-24-90)).

## First step, GA1, Ante mare undae
To generate a new polymer, the default number of TOut = 10 monomers are required in a polymer. The total number of distinct input monomer units TIn should be higher, TOut >= TIn = 10, to support the polymer specificity. These TIn monomers are presumed to be the native DNA sequences supported by ChIP-seq/RNA-seq etc. experimental edidence of specific binding of the target TF. The task of the first step is dual: 
1. to select exact output Tout monomers among the total TIn provided in input data; 
2. to denote the exact order of TOut selected monomers.

For example, if we have 20 input monomers {T1, T2, ... T20}, then the example version of the ouput order of the selected top-scored ten monomers is {T17, T2, T5, T13, T4, T1, T18, T9, T15, T11}. To find an optimal combination, GA of the first step (GA1) selects the multiple versions of polymers with the least susceptibility to the non-target TFs binding. As input data, GA1 requires:
* a set of TIn monomer units containing individual binding sites of the target TF; 
* the number of TOut monomer units of a polymer; 
* a matrix for the target TF, and a list of its recognition thresholds and respective ERRs for this matrix.

## Second step, GA2, Non est terminus ad perfectionem
The second step (GA2) selects appropriate SNS outside the essential positions the target TF binding in each monomer. Hence, GA2 requires: 
* a polymer assembled from the units comprising the target TF binding site (the essential core) flanked by several nucleotides on 5' and 3' sides (less essential flanks, non-cores); 
* a matrix for the target TF, and a list of its recognition thresholds and respective ERRs for this matrix; 
* a list of positions in the polymer (the assembled sequence from the first step) designating spacers between the essential cores and non-core elements, and flanking regions before/after the first/last monomer units of the polymer; 
* the probability P of nucleotide substitutions (SNS) within non-core elements. 

## Third step, GA3, Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius
The third step (GA3) is another application of approach developped for the preceeding second step (GA2). Here the same source code is applied to destroy any DNA binding motif, hence it is not important here BSs of which TF to exclude. Hence, BSs of neither target nor non-target TFs are now undesirable. Hence, GA3 requires:
* a polymer assembled from the units comprising the target TF binding site (the essential cores) flanked by several nucleotides on 5' and 3' sides (less essential flanks, non-cores), this polymer may be the result of either the first or second step;
* a list of positions in the polymer designating the essential cores between the non-core regions and flanking regions before/after the first/last essential cores of the polymer;
* the probability P of nucleotide substitutions (SNS) within core elements.
